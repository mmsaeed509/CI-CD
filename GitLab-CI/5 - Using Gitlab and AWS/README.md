# Gitlab CI build and deploy a Java application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk


To deploy to AWS from GitLab CI, you can use GitLab CI/CD pipelines along with AWS CLI commands or third-party deployment tools. Here's a basic example using the AWS CLI for deploying to an AWS S3 bucket:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy_to_aws:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - apt-get update -qy
    - apt-get install -y python3-pip
    - pip3 install awscli
    - aws configure set aws_access_key_id $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - aws configure set aws_secret_access_key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - aws s3 sync ./your_local_directory s3://your-s3-bucket
```

In this example:

- The pipeline has a single stage named `deploy`.
- The `deploy_to_aws` job within the `deploy` stage installs the AWS CLI, configures it with the provided access key and secret key environment variables (`$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), and then syncs a local directory (`your_local_directory`) to an S3 bucket (`your-s3-bucket`).

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your_local_directory` and `your-s3-bucket` with your actual directory and bucket names.

Before using this example, you need to:

1. Set up AWS CLI credentials in your GitLab CI/CD variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
2. Make sure the GitLab CI/CD runner has the necessary permissions to deploy to AWS (e.g., write permissions to the S3 bucket).

This is a basic example, and depending on your application, you might need to adapt it to your specific requirements. If you're deploying a more complex application (e.g., a web application), you may need additional steps such as updating a CloudFormation stack, deploying to ECS, or using other AWS services.

Remember to handle secrets and access keys securely, and consider additional security measures depending on your deployment scenario. Always follow best practices for deploying applications to cloud platforms.
